## Assignment 3A Global Baseline Estimate Approach

For this week's assignment, I will use the movie ratings data provided in the spreadsheet and implement a Global Baseline Estimate recommendation system in R. In order to do this, I will use the Global Baseline Estimate algorithm with the movie ratings data provided. The Global Baseline Estimate is one of the best non-personalized recommender system algorithms.
