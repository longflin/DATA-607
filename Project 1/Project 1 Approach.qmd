## Project 1 Approach

For Project 1, I will use the chess tournament results data set provided in the text file to create a R Markdown file that can generate a .CSV file.  The .CSV file will include the Player’s Name, Player’s State, Total Number of Points, Player’s Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents.  The chess rating system is a numerical rating system used to assess a player's relative skill level in zero-sum games.
